This C program simulates an admin system where users can log in, verify their credentials, and manage an array. </br> 
Initially, a set of admins is defined, and the program stores user data, including admin names and passwords, in a file.</br>  
The user is prompted to input their username, and if they are an admin, they are asked to enter their password. </br> 
If the password matches, the user gains access to modify an array of integers. </br> 
Non-admin users can request to become admins, provided they have a valid username and password. </br> 
The program also saves and loads user data and array values from a file, allowing for persistence across sessions. </br> 
provides a limit on login attempts and restricts the number of admins, ensuring the system remains secure.
